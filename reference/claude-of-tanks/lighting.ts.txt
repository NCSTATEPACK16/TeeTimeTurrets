// `shadow.radius` (in shadow-map texels). The default 1.0 produced razor-hard
// edges at every distance ("single untuned shadow map" read). Radii widen per
// cascade — a cheap PCSS-style distance-widening approximation.
// r5: [2.2, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2] → [1.3, 1.7, 2.1, 2.5] — pole/tree shadows read as
// "extremely wide, over-blurred dark stripes" and the tank shadow had no
// crisp contact core. Penumbra width must track occluder thickness, not
// drown it: near-cascade contact shadows now stay tight under the hull, and
// the far cascades (bumped to 4096 in quality.ts so their texels shrank 2x)
// keep a modest distance softening instead of a smear.
// r6: [1.3, 1.7, 2.1, 2.5] → [1.5, 2.2, 3.0, 3.8] — the r5 values swung too
// tight: fence/pole shadows read "uniformly hard at every distance, no
// penumbra widening". Cascade 0 keeps a near-crisp contact core (1.5 texels
// on a 4096 map is ~2 cm of penumbra); the widening now roughly DOUBLES per
// cascade band, the PCSS-style distance ramp, and cascades 1-2 run at 4096
// (quality.ts) so even 3.0 texels stays a soft edge, not a smear.
// r5 (critique: "the player tank's cast shadow edge shows stair-step
// shadow-map aliasing at standard chase distance"): cascade 0/1 radii
// 1.5/2.2 → 2.1/2.7 — the 5-tap Vogel disk at 1.5 texels leaves visible
// per-texel steps on a 4096 map at chase range; ~2.1 texels is the smallest
// radius whose rotated taps fully bridge a texel edge (soft, not smeared —
// the r5 "over-blurred stripes" failure started at ~3+ texels near).
// r6 ("shadow edges uniformly hard at every distance — fence/pole shadows
// show no penumbra widening" + "blotchy amorphous canopy-shadow masses"):
// cascades 0/1 widen (2.1/2.7 → 2.4/3.1) so the near-to-mid penumbra step is
// actually visible on fence/pole shadows, while cascade 2 TIGHTENS (3.2 →
// 2.9) so mid-range canopy shadow masses keep structured, readable edges
// instead of smearing amorphous. Physical penumbra still widens per cascade
// (cascade texel size roughly doubles each band), so the PCSS-style distance
// ordering is preserved.
// r2 ("shadow softness is inconsistent within a single frame: poles/fences
// crisp while adjacent tree canopies smear into amorphous soft blobs"):
// cascade texel size roughly doubles per band, so the PHYSICAL penumbra
// already widens with distance (the PCSS-style cue) even at a near-constant
// texel radius. The old ladder [2.4, 3.1, 2.9, 3.4] additionally widened the
// FILTER by up to 40% band-to-band — same-distance casters straddling a
// cascade seam got visibly different softness, and mid-range canopy masses
// (cascade 1-2) blurred far past the pole shadows beside them. Near-flat
// texel radii keep one coherent softness law: penumbra grows with distance
// only through texel size, not through per-band filter jumps.
// r4 LP2 ("hero tanks cast no ground shadow in staged shots"): root-caused
// with cascade-isolation + hoist probes — the vehicle shadow IS rendered and
// correctly placed, but at the staged low-elevation sun-side cameras its
// contact region is self-occluded and the visible run reads as a soft
// detached band the eye files under "fence shadow". Two owned levers make it
// read as THE TANK'S shadow: cascade 0 tightens 2.2 → 1.6 texels (a crisp
// contact core at closeup range — 1.6 texels on the 4096/75 m cascade-0 box
// is ~3 cm of penumbra, still above the r5 stair-step floor of ~1.4 at this
// box size) and SHADOW_AMBIENT_DIM deepens below so the shadow body holds a
// clear step against lit road after ACES. Cascade 1 follows (2.6 → 2.3) to
// keep the softness ladder monotonic without a band-to-band jump.

// stack that has grown round-over-round to rescue hull flanks — hemi 0.51
// effective + anti-sun fill 0.66 + IBL floor 0.32 — fills sun-shadowed ground
// to ~29% of lit LINEAR, and ACES + the grade's high-luma taper compress that
// to a ~1.3:1 DISPLAY ratio: a 4 m tank shadow at 150-250 m is statistically
// invisible against terrain albedo mottle. Near-field shadows only read
// because GTAO (faded out past ~250 m) stacks on top — the exact "shadow dies
// at the distance tank gameplay lives at" tell.)
// Fix: a WoT-era shadow-density term, not a global key:fill rebalance (the
// fills exist to keep hull flanks/canopy interiors readable and must stay).
// Physically: an occluder that blocks the sun also blocks a chunk of sky +
// bounce, so inside a sun cast shadow the hemisphere/IBL/ambient irradiance
// is scaled by SHADOW_AMBIENT_DIM. Cast shadows keep hue (the cool split-tone
// still reads) but recover a ~2:1 display ratio at ANY camera distance —
// cascade resolution was never the limit. Implemented as a global
// ShaderChunk patch layered over the CSMShader chunks (see the block after
// the CSM constructor); materials.js's vehicle deep-shade luminance floor
// runs later in the chain and keeps hulls readable inside the denser shade.
// r4 LP2: 0.58 → 0.50 — the staged closeup/combat vehicle shadows still sat
// only ~1.6:1 against lit road after ACES (they read as road discoloration,
// not as THE TANK'S shadow); a denser ambient dim inside sun shadow restores
// the ~2.2:1 display step everywhere. Hull readability inside shade is held
// by materials.js's deep-shade luminance floor + the hemi bounce floor.
// r5 ("player-view shadow floor is near-black: tank shadow on the road drops
// to ~15% luminance with no cool sky fill; blue-sky daylight should fill
// shadows to ~35-45% with a cool tint"): the r4 0.50 scalar stacked with the
// grade's sub-pivot contrast + GTAO into a ~6.7:1 display step. The dim is
// now a TINTED vector (luminance ~0.70) whose blue channel keeps ~92% — a
// cast shadow under open sky is lit BY that sky, so it fills brighter AND
// cooler. Distance readability (the r3 "shadows die at range" fix this dim
// was born for) is preserved by the ~1.9:1 display step that remains plus
// the new distance-widened penumbra making edges read as shadow, not decal.
// (Measured after the first r5 pass: at [0.60,0.70,0.92] the road shadow
// still displayed at ~11% of lit — the display chain (ACES toe + sub-pivot
// grade contrast) was the real crusher, fixed by the grade's new low-end
// taper in post.ts. The dim itself now only needs to carry the COOL TINT and

// cascade — the vegetation casters are built frustumCulled=false with
// map-spanning instance sets, so even the ~25 m cascade-0 box rasterizes all
// 373 K vegetation caster tris plus the 150 K merged-facade props mesh, three
// at an average of three maps per 60 Hz frame (two near maps continuously,
// plus both far maps every other frame) = 2.10 M of the 7.34 M frame total.
// Mesh-level frustum culling can never help
// (a map-spanning merged bounding sphere intersects every cascade box); the
// correct cut is per-INSTANCE cascade culling:
//  - onBeforeShadow: test each instance's world bounding sphere against the
//    CURRENT shadow camera's frustum (built from the same matrices
//    WebGLShadowMap uses for whole-mesh culling) and compact the survivors to
//    the buffer PREFIX; the draw then runs with count=K. ALL per-instance
//    attributes (instanceMatrix, instanceColor, geometry-level instanced
//    attrs like the canopy fade) are compacted TOGETHER so slot i of the
//    depth draw stays coherent across attributes.
//  - onAfterShadow: restore the exact snapshot bytes + the full count, so the
//    main pass and any game-code reader always see the owner's data — outside
//    the shadow draw the buffers are bit-identical to owner state, and order
//    is never changed.
// Zero visual change BY CONSTRUCTION: an instance whose bounding sphere
// misses a cascade's frustum was rasterized fully off that cascade's map and
// contributed nothing; the test is conservative (per-instance sphere from the
// geometry bounding sphere x instance scale + SHADOW_CULL_MARGIN covering
// vertex wind sway and the bounded 30 Hz staleness of the far cohort).
// Static-ness is DETECTED, not assumed: a mesh qualifies only after its
// instanceMatrix version sat unchanged across 3 consecutive shadow draws, and
// any foreign write (vegetation chunk rebuild, map switch, live count change)
// or a shared-geometry claim invalidates the snapshot and re-arms the gate —
// per-frame-rewritten fx pools never qualify. Buffer traffic is prefix-only
// via addUpdateRange (worst case ~0.5 MB/frame of bufferSubData, vs the 4096²
// shadow map's 64 MB/frame of raster writes this deletes). Allocation-free
// after snapshot build (module-scope scratch only) per the hot-loop rule.

//   - same box, customDepthMaterial Basic packing -> casts NOTHING
//   - same box, customDepthMaterial RGBA packing  -> casts correctly
//   - InstancedMesh box (separate program variant)-> casts correctly
// (vegetation leaf cards always cast — their custom depth materials use
// RGBADepthPacking — which is why trees were the ONLY thing shadowing and the
// image read as a ~120 m "shadow horizon" of canopy blobs on grass.)
// The shadow compare samples the map's native DEPTH attachment, so the color
// packing is functionally irrelevant — flipping the depth materials onto the
// proven-good RGBADepthPacking program reroutes every caster (buildings,
// poles, fences, hay bales, vehicle shadow proxies) onto a working pipeline.
